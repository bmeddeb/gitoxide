# gix-hashtable Use Cases

## Intended Audience

The `gix-hashtable` crate is designed for developers working with Git repositories at scale, particularly those who:

- Build Git tooling (e.g., clients, servers, or analyzers)
- Need high-performance object storage/retrieval (e.g., monorepo tooling, CI/CD systems)
- Work in multi-threaded environments (e.g., parallel Git operations)
- Prioritize low-overhead data structures (e.g., performance-critical applications)

## General Use Cases

### 1. Git Object Deduplication

**Scenario**: Track unique Git objects (blobs, trees, commits) in memory.

**Why**: The `HashSet<ObjectId>` avoids storing duplicate objects, leveraging the crate's zero-overhead hashing for fast lookups.

**Example**: A Git server verifying incoming objects during a push operation.

### 2. Metadata Caching

**Scenario**: Cache parsed commit/tree metadata (e.g., author timestamps, file hierarchies).

**Why**: `HashMap<ObjectId, Metadata>` allows O(1) access to preprocessed data, bypassing repeated disk/network reads.

### 3. Concurrent Object Processing

**Scenario**: Parallel processing of Git objects across threads (e.g., batch blame calculations).

**Why**: The thread-safe `sync::ObjectIdMap` enables lock-sharded concurrent writes/reads with minimal contention.

### 4. Graph Traversal

**Scenario**: Traverse commit/tree graphs for operations like `git log` or dependency resolution.

**Why**: Efficient `HashMap` lookups speed up parent/child relationship tracking in large histories.

### 5. Delta Compression Optimization

**Scenario**: Identify candidate objects for delta compression in packfiles.

**Why**: Fast `HashSet` membership checks help quickly find similar objects to delta against.

## Special/Niche Use Cases

### 1. Real-Time Git Operations

**Scenario**: A low-latency Git HTTP API serving object metadata.

**Why**: The optimized hashing reduces per-request overhead, critical for sub-millisecond response times.

### 2. Massive Monorepos

**Scenario**: Processing repositories with millions of objects (e.g., FAANG-scale monorepos).

**Why**: Avoiding hash recomputation saves CPU cycles at scale, reducing memory and compute costs.

### 3. In-Memory Git Databases

**Scenario**: Ephemeral Git object stores for CI/CD pipelines.

**Why**: The crate's lean design minimizes memory footprint while handling high-throughput operations.

### 4. Security Scanners

**Scenario**: Scanning Git histories for secrets/vulnerabilities.

**Why**: Fast lookups enable efficient tracking of already-scanned objects across incremental runs.

### 5. Distributed Git Systems

**Scenario**: Sharding Git data across nodes in a distributed cache.

**Why**: The thread-safe map's sharding strategy aligns naturally with distributed partitioning schemes.

## Key Differentiators

- **Zero-Cost Hashing**: Directly uses ObjectId bytes as hashes, bypassing traditional hashing overhead.

- **Thread-Safety Without Contention**: Sharded locks allow concurrent access to distinct ObjectId ranges.

- **Git-First Optimization**: Tailored for Git's 20-byte SHA1/SHA256 object IDs, unlike generic hash tables.

## When Not to Use

- Non-Git workflows (the optimizations are Git-specific).

- Applications requiring generic key types (e.g., non-ObjectId keys).

- Trivial/small-scale object tracking where standard libraries suffice.
