# gix-path Use Cases

## Intended Audience

The `gix-path` crate is designed for developers who:

- Build cross-platform Git implementations or tools
- Need to handle paths in Git repositories consistently across platforms
- Work with paths that may contain non-UTF-8 sequences
- Need to manipulate relative paths without filesystem access

## General Use Cases

### 1. Cross-Platform Path Handling

**Scenario**: Working with Git repositories across different operating systems (Unix, Windows).

**Why**: Git internally uses forward slashes (`/`) as path separators, but Windows expects backslashes (`\`). The crate handles these conversions transparently.

**Example**: Converting paths stored in Git's database to native format for filesystem operations.

### 2. Path Normalization

**Scenario**: Processing user-provided or repository-stored paths that may contain redundant components like `.` and `..`.

**Why**: Normalizing paths is essential for path comparison, storage efficiency, and presenting clean paths to users.

**Example**: Normalizing paths for display in Git user interfaces or for comparison operations.

### 3. Symlink Resolution

**Scenario**: Following symbolic links in a Git repository to determine the actual file structure.

**Why**: Git often needs to know the "real" paths of files, especially when dealing with symbolic links that might create cycles.

**Example**: Determining the actual location of a file referenced by a symlink in a Git repository.

### 4. Cross-Platform Path Byte Representation

**Scenario**: Reading and writing paths in Git's internal formats, which might not be valid UTF-8.

**Why**: Git stores paths as byte sequences, which may not be valid UTF-8, particularly problematic on Windows which requires UTF-16.

**Example**: Storing and retrieving paths from Git's index, object database, or config files.

### 5. Relative Path Manipulation

**Scenario**: Converting between absolute and relative paths for display and storage.

**Why**: Git often displays paths relative to the repository root or current working directory, requiring efficient relative path computation.

**Example**: Displaying changed files relative to the current directory in Git status output.

## Special/Niche Use Cases

### 1. Windows UTF-16 Surrogate Handling

**Scenario**: Dealing with Windows paths that contain emojis or other characters that use UTF-16 surrogate pairs.

**Why**: Certain Windows versions and configurations can produce or expect paths with surrogate pairs, which require special handling when converting to Git's internal representation.

**Example**: Correctly handling repository paths that contain emoji characters on Windows systems.

### 2. Path Manipulation Without Filesystem Access

**Scenario**: Normalizing or manipulating paths without accessing the filesystem.

**Why**: Many Git operations need to manipulate paths (e.g., resolving relative paths) without actually accessing the filesystem for performance or security reasons.

**Example**: Normalizing paths in large Git repositories without hitting the filesystem for each path.

### 3. Environment Path Resolution

**Scenario**: Finding Git-related files and directories in platform-specific locations.

**Why**: Git configurations and repositories may be located in different standard locations depending on the platform.

**Example**: Locating global Git configuration files in platform-appropriate locations.

### 4. Safe Path Rewriting

**Scenario**: Converting between byte-based paths and platform-native paths without data loss.

**Why**: Git's internal path representation might not be directly usable by the operating system, requiring careful conversion that preserves all path information.

**Example**: Converting paths from Git's index to a format that can be used for filesystem operations.

### 5. Path Component Validation

**Scenario**: Validating path components against Git's rules before allowing them to be used.

**Why**: Git has specific rules about valid path components (e.g., no `.git` directory in a path).

**Example**: Validating file paths before adding them to a Git repository.

## Key Differentiators

- **Platform-Aware Path Handling**: Automatically handles the differences between Unix and Windows path conventions.

- **Safe UTF-8 Handling**: Correctly handles UTF-8 errors that can occur on Windows when dealing with certain path characters.

- **Git-Specific Path Conventions**: Follows Git's internal path representation rules, ensuring compatibility with the Git ecosystem.

- **Path Manipulation Without I/O**: Provides utilities for manipulating paths without accessing the filesystem, improving performance and safety.

## When Not to Use

- When you don't need to handle cross-platform path issues (e.g., Unix-only applications).

- When your paths are guaranteed to be valid UTF-8 and don't need the special handling this crate provides.

- For general-purpose path manipulation where standard library facilities like `std::path` are sufficient.
