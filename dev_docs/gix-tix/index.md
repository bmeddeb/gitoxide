# gix-tix

## Overview

`gix-tix` is a crate in the gitoxide ecosystem intended to serve as a minimal, fast, and efficient text-mode interface for Git repositories, similar to the popular tool `tig`. While the crate is currently in the very early stages of development (version 0.0.0), it aims to provide a terminal-based user interface (TUI) for browsing and interacting with Git repositories using the gitoxide libraries.

## Architecture

When fully implemented, `gix-tix` is expected to follow a modular architecture with separation between:

1. **UI Components**: Widgets and displays for various Git views (commit log, diff, blame, etc.)
2. **Git Interop**: Interface with gitoxide libraries for repository operations
3. **Input Handling**: Processing keyboard and possibly mouse input
4. **State Management**: Managing application state and navigation

The crate will likely use a TUI library such as `crossterm`, `tui-rs`, or a similar framework for terminal UI rendering, while leveraging the gitoxide ecosystem for Git functionality.

## Core Components

Since the crate is in very early stages of development, the following components are speculative and represent what would be expected in a full implementation:

### Structs

| Struct | Description | Usage |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `App` | Main application state container | Central point for managing application state |
| `CommitLogView` | View for browsing commit history | Displays a navigable list of commits |
| `DiffView` | View for displaying commit diffs | Shows changes in a commit |
| `BlameView` | View for git blame functionality | Shows line-by-line attribution |
| `BranchView` | View for branch management | Shows and allows manipulating branches |

### Traits

| Trait | Description | Implementors |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `View` | Interface for UI views | `CommitLogView`, `DiffView`, `BlameView`, etc. |
| `Navigable` | Interface for navigable components | Views that support navigation |
| `Filterable` | Interface for components that can be filtered | Views that support filtering |

### Functions

| Function | Description | Signature |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `run` | Main entry point to start the application | `fn run(repo_path: &Path) -> Result<(), Error>` |
| `navigate` | Handle navigation within views | `fn navigate(direction: Direction) -> Result<(), Error>` |
| `show_commit` | Display details for a specific commit | `fn show_commit(commit_id: &ObjectId) -> Result<(), Error>` |

### Enums

| Enum | Description | Variants |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `ViewType` | Types of available views | `Log`, `Diff`, `Blame`, `Branch`, etc. |
| `Direction` | Navigation direction | `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `PageUp`, `PageDown` |
| `Action` | User action | `Select`, `Back`, `Quit`, `Help`, etc. |

## Dependencies

The following dependencies would be expected in a full implementation:

### Internal Dependencies

| Crate | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `gix` | Core Git functionality |
| `gix-hash` | Object hash handling |
| `gix-object` | Git object manipulation |
| `gix-diff` | Diff generation |
| `gix-blame` | Blame functionality |
| `gix-revwalk` | Walking commit history |

### External Dependencies

| Crate | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `crossterm` | Terminal manipulation and input handling |
| `tui-rs` | Terminal user interface widgets and rendering |
| `thiserror` | Error type definitions |
| `clap` | Command line argument parsing |
| `unicode-width` | Unicode text width calculation for proper display |

## Feature Flags

Potential feature flags for future implementation:

| Flag | Description | Dependencies Enabled |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `mouse` | Enable mouse support | Additional input handlers |
| `syntax-highlight` | Syntax highlighting for diffs | Syntax highlighting library |
| `async` | Asynchronous operation for better responsiveness | Async runtime |

## Examples

While the crate is not yet implemented, here's how the API might look when complete:

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use gix_tix::{App, Config};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create a configuration
    let config = Config::default()
        .with_mouse_support(true)
        .with_syntax_highlighting(true);
    
    // Initialize the application with a repository path
    let app = App::new(Path::new("/path/to/repo"), config)?;
    
    // Run the application
    app.run()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Implementation Details

When fully implemented, `gix-tix` would provide a text-based interface similar to `tig` but built on the modern and efficient gitoxide libraries. Key implementation considerations would include:

### User Interface

- **Terminal Rendering**: Efficient terminal rendering with support for colors and possibly Unicode graphics
- **Responsive UI**: Non-blocking UI that remains responsive even during Git operations
- **Layout Management**: Flexible layout system for different terminal sizes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Intuitive keyboard navigation similar to `tig` or other TUI applications

### Git Integration

- **Efficient Display**: Fast display of Git repository information using gitoxide's efficient implementations
- **Background Operations**: Long-running Git operations performed in background threads
- **Incremental Loading**: Loading large repositories or diffs incrementally for better performance

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Efficiency**: Careful memory management to handle large repositories
- **Lazy Loading**: Loading and rendering only visible content
- **Caching**: Caching frequently accessed data for better performance

## Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy for future implementation would include:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interaction between components
3. **Visual Tests**: Framework for testing visual rendering
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensuring performance with large repositories
5. **Cross-platform Tests**: Ensuring functionality across different operating systems and terminal emulators
