# gix-tix Use Cases

This document describes anticipated use cases for the `gix-tix` crate, which is designed to be a minimal, fast, and efficient text-mode interface for Git repositories, similar to the popular `tig` tool.

## Intended Audience

- Git users who prefer terminal-based interfaces
- Developers working in environments without GUI access
- System administrators managing Git repositories on servers
- Developers building custom Git workflow tools
- Users of low-resource computing environments

## Use Case 1: Browsing Commit History

### Problem

A developer needs to quickly review the commit history of a repository, understand commit relationships, and examine the changes in specific commits without leaving the terminal.

### Solution

`gix-tix` provides a fast and efficient interface for browsing commit history with a commit log view.

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use gix_tix::{App, ViewType};

fn browse_repository_history(repo_path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Open the repository
    let repo_path = Path::new(repo_path);
    
    // Create the application with the commit log as the initial view
    let mut app = App::new(repo_path)?
        .with_initial_view(ViewType::Log);
    
    // Configure commit log display options
    app.configure_view(ViewType::Log, |config| {
        config
            .show_graph(true)
            .show_author(true)
            .show_date(true)
            .show_refs(true)
    });
    
    // Run the application
    app.run()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

In the text interface, the user would see a commit log with a graphical representation of the commit history, allowing them to:

- Navigate through commits with arrow keys
- Press Enter on a commit to view its full details
- Press 'D' to view the diff for the selected commit
- Use '/' to search for specific text in commit messages or changes
- Press 'Q' to exit back or quit the application

## Use Case 2: Inspecting File Changes

### Problem

A developer needs to examine changes to specific files across commits, understanding who made changes and why, without switching tools.

### Solution

`gix-tix` offers a blame view for tracking changes to individual files over time.

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use gix_tix::{App, ViewType, BlameOptions};

fn inspect_file_history(repo_path: &str, file_path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Open the repository
    let repo_path = Path::new(repo_path);
    
    // Create the application with the blame view as the initial view
    let mut app = App::new(repo_path)?;
    
    // Configure blame options
    let blame_options = BlameOptions::default()
        .show_line_numbers(true)
        .show_date(true)
        .detect_moves(true);
    
    // Open the blame view for the specified file
    app.open_blame_view(file_path, blame_options)?;
    
    // Run the application
    app.run()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

In the interface, the user would see:

- Line-by-line attribution of the file's contents
- Author information alongside each line
- Commit date and message for each block of changes
- The ability to navigate to the full commit that introduced a change
- Options to view previous versions of the file

## Use Case 3: Reviewing and Staging Changes

### Problem

A developer has made multiple changes across several files and needs to carefully review and selectively stage them for commit.

### Solution

`gix-tix` provides a stage view for reviewing and selectively staging changes.

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use gix_tix::{App, ViewType, StageOptions};

fn review_and_stage_changes(repo_path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Open the repository
    let repo_path = Path::new(repo_path);
    
    // Create the application with the stage view as the initial view
    let mut app = App::new(repo_path)?
        .with_initial_view(ViewType::Status);
    
    // Configure staging options
    let stage_options = StageOptions::default()
        .allow_patch_selection(true)
        .show_untracked_files(true);
    
    app.configure_view(ViewType::Stage, |config| {
        config.with_options(stage_options)
    });
    
    // Run the application
    app.run()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

In the interface, the user would be able to:

- See a list of modified, added, and deleted files
- Navigate to a diff view for each file
- Select specific hunks or even lines to stage
- Stage, unstage, or discard changes
- Create a commit with the staged changes

## Use Case 4: Managing Branches and References

### Problem

A developer needs to visualize the branch structure of a repository, understand which commits are in which branches, and manage references.

### Solution

`gix-tix` offers a branch view for visualizing and managing branches and references.

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use gix_tix::{App, ViewType, BranchOptions};

fn manage_branches(repo_path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Open the repository
    let repo_path = Path::new(repo_path);
    
    // Create the application with the branch view as the initial view
    let mut app = App::new(repo_path)?
        .with_initial_view(ViewType::Branch);
    
    // Configure branch view options
    let branch_options = BranchOptions::default()
        .show_remote_branches(true)
        .show_tags(true)
        .sort_by_committer_date(true);
    
    app.configure_view(ViewType::Branch, |config| {
        config.with_options(branch_options)
    });
    
    // Run the application
    app.run()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

In the interface, the user would see:

- A list of local and remote branches
- Tags and other references
- The commit each reference points to
- The ability to checkout, create, rename, or delete branches
- Options to merge or rebase branches

## Use Case 5: Exploring Large Repositories

### Problem

A developer needs to explore a large repository with thousands of commits and files, requiring efficient navigation and search capabilities.

### Solution

`gix-tix` is designed to handle large repositories efficiently with search and filtering capabilities.

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use gix_tix::{App, ViewType, SearchOptions};

fn explore_large_repository(repo_path: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Open the repository
    let repo_path = Path::new(repo_path);
    
    // Create the application with performance options for large repositories
    let mut app = App::new(repo_path)?
        .with_performance_mode(true)
        .with_initial_view(ViewType::Log);
    
    // Configure search options
    let search_options = SearchOptions::default()
        .case_sensitive(false)
        .regex_support(true)
        .include_diff_content(true);
    
    app.set_search_options(search_options);
    
    // Run the application
    app.run()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

In the interface, the user would benefit from:

- Lazy loading of commit information as needed
- Efficient search across commit messages, authors, and content
- Filtering options to focus on specific authors, date ranges, or file paths
- Keyboard shortcuts for rapid navigation
- A responsive interface even when dealing with thousands of commits

## Use Case 6: Custom Git Workflow Integration

### Problem

A development team has specific Git workflows and needs a customized interface that integrates with their process.

### Solution

`gix-tix` can be extended or embedded in other applications to provide custom Git interfaces.

```rust
use std::path::Path;
use gix_tix::{App, ViewType, KeyBinding, Action};

fn create_custom_workflow_tool(repo_path: &str, workflow_config: &str) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Load custom workflow configuration
    let workflow = load_workflow_config(workflow_config)?;
    
    // Open the repository
    let repo_path = Path::new(repo_path);
    
    // Create the application with custom configuration
    let mut app = App::new(repo_path)?;
    
    // Add custom key bindings
    app.add_key_binding(KeyBinding::new('R', Action::Custom("run-tests")));
    app.add_key_binding(KeyBinding::new('P', Action::Custom("propose-pr")));
    
    // Register custom action handlers
    app.on_custom_action("run-tests", |app, _| {
        // Execute test suite
        app.execute_command("make test")?;
        Ok(())
    });
    
    app.on_custom_action("propose-pr", |app, _| {
        // Open PR creation interface
        app.switch_to_view(ViewType::Custom("pr-form"))?;
        Ok(())
    });
    
    // Run the application
    app.run()?;
    
    Ok(())
}

fn load_workflow_config(config_path: &str) -> Result<WorkflowConfig, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Implementation to load workflow configuration
    // ...
    Ok(WorkflowConfig::default())
}

struct WorkflowConfig {
    // Configuration fields
}

impl WorkflowConfig {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {}
    }
}
```

In the interface, team members would have:

- Custom keyboard shortcuts for workflow-specific actions
- Integrated tools for code review, testing, and deployment
- Team-specific views and functionality
- Consistent interface across the development environment

## Summary

When fully implemented, `gix-tix` will provide a versatile text-mode interface for Git repositories, enabling users to:

1. **Browse and search** commit history efficiently
2. **Inspect changes** at the file and line level
3. **Review and stage** changes selectively
4. **Manage branches and references** with visual clarity
5. **Navigate large repositories** with performance-optimized interfaces
6. **Integrate with custom workflows** through extensibility

These capabilities will make `gix-tix` valuable for developers working in terminal environments, providing much of the functionality of graphical Git clients while maintaining the efficiency and resource usage advantages of text-based interfaces. Built on the modern and efficient gitoxide libraries, `gix-tix` aims to be faster and more resource-efficient than traditional tools like `tig` while providing a familiar and intuitive user experience.
