# Gitoxide Developer Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for each crate in the gitoxide workspace. The goal is to provide an in-depth understanding of the entire codebase, its architecture, and how components interact.

## Getting Started

Start with the [index.md](./index.md) file, which contains a checklist of all crates and their documentation status.

## Documentation Structure

Each crate has its own directory with an `index.md` file that documents:

- Overview of the crate's purpose
- Architecture and design principles
- Core components (structs, traits, functions)
- Dependencies on other crates
- Feature flags and their effects
- Example usage
- Implementation details

## Template

When documenting a new crate, you can use the [template.md](./template.md) file as a starting point.

## Progress

The documentation effort is ongoing. See the [index.md](./index.md) file for current progress.

## Contributing

To contribute to this documentation:

1. Pick an undocumented crate from [index.md](./index.md)
2. Create or update the documentation following the template structure
3. Update the checklist in index.md to mark the crate as documented
4. Update the progress tracking section in index.md
