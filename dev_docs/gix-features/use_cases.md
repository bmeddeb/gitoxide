# gix-features Use Cases

## Intended Audience

- **Application Developers**: Building Git applications with control over binary size and performance tradeoffs
- **Library Maintainers**: Creating Git-related libraries that need to adapt to various environments
- **Performance Engineers**: Optimizing Git operations for specific deployment scenarios

## Use Cases

### 1. Binary Size Optimization

**Problem**: Git applications for embedded systems or WebAssembly targets need minimal binary size.

**Solution**: Use `gix-features` with minimal feature flags to exclude unnecessary functionality:

```rust
// Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
gix-features = { version = "0.42", default-features = false }
```

**Result**: Produces minimal binaries for resource-constrained environments.

### 2. Parallel Processing for Performance

**Problem**: Git operations on large repositories are slow when processing sequentially.

**Solution**: Enable the `parallel` feature to utilize multi-threading:

```rust
// Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
gix-features = { version = "0.42", features = ["parallel"] }
```

```rust
// Process objects in parallel
let result = gix_features::parallel::in_parallel(
    objects.into_iter(),
    None,                   // Default thread count
    |_| (),                 // Thread state
    |obj, _| process(obj),  // Process each object
    results_collector,      // Combine results
)?;
```

**Result**: Significantly faster operations on multi-core systems with minimal code changes.

### 3. Progress Reporting for User Experience

**Problem**: Long-running Git operations provide no feedback to users.

**Solution**: Enable the `progress` features for standardized progress reporting:

```rust
// Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
gix-features = { version = "0.42", features = ["progress", "progress-unit-bytes"] }
```

```rust
fn process_with_progress(data: &[u8], progress: &impl gix_features::progress::Progress) -> Result<()> {
    progress.init(Some(data.len()), gix_features::progress::bytes());
    // Process data with progress updates
    Ok(())
}
```

**Result**: Better user experience with consistent progress reporting.

### 4. Graceful Interruption

**Problem**: Git operations are hard to cancel safely once started.

**Solution**: Use interruption utilities to make operations cancellable:

```rust
let interrupt_flag = std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool::new(false);

// In UI thread: handle cancel button
cancel_button.on_click(|| interrupt_flag.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed));

// In worker thread: use interruptible operations
let reader = gix_features::interrupt::Read {
    inner: std::fs::File::open(path)?,
    should_interrupt: &interrupt_flag,
};
```

**Result**: Operations that can be safely cancelled while preserving data integrity.

### 5. Selective Compression Support

**Problem**: Some environments need compression while others don't, adding unnecessary dependencies.

**Solution**: Use the `zlib` feature flag selectively:

```rust
// Cargo.toml for servers with compression
[dependencies]
gix-features = { version = "0.42", features = ["zlib"] }

// Cargo.toml for clients without compression
[dependencies]
gix-features = { version = "0.42", default-features = false }
```

**Result**: Optimized dependency tree based on actual needs.

### 6. Development-Only Diagnostics

**Problem**: Cache inefficiencies are hard to detect in production code.

**Solution**: Enable development-only diagnostics:

```rust
// Cargo.toml for development builds
[dependencies]
gix-features = { version = "0.42", features = ["cache-efficiency-debug"] }
```

**Result**: Detailed information about cache hits/misses during development without overhead in production.

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistent API**: Same code works regardless of enabled features
2. **Flexible Deployments**: Tailor the implementation to each target environment
3. **Performance Control**: Choose between size and speed optimizations explicitly
4. **Future-Proofing**: Add performance improvements behind feature flags without breaking API compatibility
