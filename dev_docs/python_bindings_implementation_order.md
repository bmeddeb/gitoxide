# Python Bindings Implementation Order

This document outlines the order in which gitoxide components should be exposed in the Python bindings, organized by priority and dependency relationships.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Repository Access

These components form the foundation of repository interaction:

1. **gix** - The main entry point for accessing repositories
   - Primary user-facing API with repository operations
   - Depends on most other crates

2. **gix-discover** - Repository discovery functionality
   - Required for finding and opening repositories
   - Used for `Repository.open()` implementation

3. **gix-path** - Path handling utilities
   - Required for cross-platform path operations
   - Used throughout repository operations

4. **gix-url** - URL handling for Git repositories
   - Required for repository cloning and remotes
   - Used for `Repository.clone()` implementation

5. **gix-repository** (via gix) - Repository manipulation
   - Core repository operations
   - Depends on gix-discover and others

### Phase 2: Object and Reference Management

Building on repository access to work with Git objects and references:

6. **gix-object** - Git object handling
   - Representation of blobs, trees, commits, tags
   - Core to most Git operations

7. **gix-ref** - Reference management
   - Branches, tags, and other references
   - Required for many repository operations

8. **gix-config** - Git configuration
   - Reading and writing configuration
   - Required for respecting repository settings

9. **gix-actor** - Author and committer information
   - Used for commits and tags
   - Required for the `Signature` class implementation

### Phase 3: Working Directory and Advanced Operations

After core functionality is in place, expose operations for working with files:

10. **gix-index** - Git index operations
    - Stage and unstage changes
    - Required for commit preparation

11. **gix-diff** - Diffing functionality
    - Compare blobs, trees, and working directory
    - Required for status and diff commands

12. **gix-status** - Working directory status
    - Show changed files
    - Built on gix-diff and gix-index

13. **gix-worktree** - Working tree operations
    - Checkout and modify files
    - Core to many user-facing operations

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

These components provide more specialized functionality, but wrapped in high-level, porcelain-style APIs:

14. **Remote Operations** (using gix, not directly exposing gix-transport or gix-protocol)
    - Fetch, pull, and push implementation
    - Implemented as high-level methods on Repository class
    - Uses gix-transport and gix-protocol internally but doesn't expose them

15. **gix-mailmap** - Mailmap support (via high-level interface)
    - Author mapping and normalization
    - Used for commit display

16. **History and Log** (using gix, not directly exposing gix-revwalk)
    - Repository history traversal
    - Commit logs and history exploration
    - Uses gix-revwalk internally but doesn't expose it

### Phase 5: Specialized Operations

These are more advanced or specialized operations to expose through high-level interfaces:

17. **gix-blame** - Git blame functionality
    - Line-by-line history tracking
    - Exposed as a high-level, user-friendly API

18. **gix-archive** - Repository archiving
    - Create archive files from repository
    - Simplified API for creating archives

19. **gix-submodule** - Submodule operations
    - High-level interface for working with submodules
    - Simplified operations like init, update, status

20. **Attributes Handling** (high-level only, not directly exposing gix-attributes)
    - Simplified gitattributes operations
    - Uses gix-attributes internally but doesn't expose low-level details

## Implementation Strategy

For each crate, the implementation process should follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the crate's public API**
   - Identify key structs, methods, and functions
   - Determine what should be exposed to Python

2. **Design Pythonic wrappers**
   - Create intuitive Python classes and methods
   - Map Rust types to appropriate Python types

3. **Implement synchronous API first**
   - Focus on the blocking implementation initially
   - Test thoroughly with unit and integration tests

4. **Add asynchronous API**
   - Mirror the synchronous API with async versions
   - Ensure proper error propagation and cancellation

5. **Document the API**
   - Add comprehensive docstrings
   - Include usage examples

## Dependencies and Build Considerations

When implementing bindings for each crate, keep these considerations in mind:

1. **Feature flags** - Each crate may require specific feature flags
2. **Versioning** - Ensure version compatibility between crates
3. **Error handling** - Map Rust errors to appropriate Python exceptions
4. **Memory management** - Properly handle object lifetimes and cleanup
5. **Threading** - Release GIL where appropriate for performance

## Detailed Component Breakdown

This section maps high-level Python APIs to their underlying Rust crate dependencies. Note that the Python API will not directly expose these crates but will use them internally.

### Repository Operations (High-Level Python API)
- **Open**: Using gix, gix-discover internally
- **Init**: Using gix internally
- **Clone**: Using gix internally (which uses gix-transport, gix-protocol)
- **Fetch/Pull**: Using gix internally (which uses gix-transport, gix-protocol)

### Object Manipulation (High-Level Python API)
- **Blobs**: Using gix-object internally
- **Trees**: Using gix-object internally
- **Commits**: Using gix-object, gix-actor internally
- **Tags**: Using gix-object, gix-actor internally

### Reference Management (High-Level Python API)
- **Branches**: Using gix-ref internally
- **Tags**: Using gix-ref internally
- **HEAD**: Using gix-ref internally

### Working Directory (High-Level Python API)
- **Status**: Using gix-status, gix-diff, gix-index internally
